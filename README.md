# Fullstack Blog App Project

In this project I used the React on frontend side and Django on Backend side. Each users can see posted blogs; likes, comments and view counts belongs to the blog. Each user can only like one time for a blog and view count only one time decrease for each view. Also logged in users can post new blogs, update or delete their blogs. Also users can update their profiles, too.

## You can see documents.
